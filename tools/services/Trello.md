# [Trello](https://trello.com)

Trello is a digital implementation of a kanban baord. Well, it can be. It can also be anything else you can imagine, as long as it has lists and tasks. I use it for a variety of things, mostly to keep track of ideas and to manage projects.

## Shortcuts
* `Q` - Only show cards assigned to you
* `CTRL + <Assigned Key>` - Add a Tag to a task (Tag has to be given a shortcut in the Tag window first)
