# [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/)

I use Things to keep track of all my daily todos and longer lasting projects I started. Sometimes, the content between Things and a Trello board can be duplicate, but they serve different purposes.  
Things gives me a lower level view of next actions I can take. Trello is giving me a higher level overview of what needs to be done to achieve something. Usually, cards in Trello will be more documented than tasks in Things. A task in Things is more of a reminder for me to do something on a specific date.

I also try to use a GTD like approach whil using things. Usually, everything I have on my mind starts here as a task in my inbox, because I always have a device with me that has access to things.
