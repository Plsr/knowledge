> A growing repository of everything I learned

_Note: If you are looking at this in GitHub, I suggest you head over to [[](wiki.christianpoplawski.de)](https://wiki.christianpoplawski.de) as it is a much more pleasent browsing experience._

## What topics are in here?
Pretty much everything. I started this as a repository of quick notes of learning I had while programming. A while ago, I stumble over [Nikita's wiki](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz) and decided to go all in. Since then, this is a place for pretty much everything I learned, independent from its general area.
