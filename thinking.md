## Motte-and-bailey fallacy

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Motte-and-bailey_fallacy)

When an arguer combines to positions, one easy to defend and the other one
controversial and much harder to defend. When challanged on their position, they
will claim to only advance on the modes position.

Example:  
A: Homeopathic medicine can cure cancer. (bailey)  
B: Thereâ€™s no evidence showing homeopathy is effective.  
A: Actually there are many ways for people to be healthy besides taking doctor-prescribed drugs. (motte)
