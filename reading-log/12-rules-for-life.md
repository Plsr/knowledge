## Foreword

- People need shared belief systems in order to be able to trust their peers. A shared belief system makes people predictable. People will generally go to extreme measures (i.e. Cold War) in order to protect their belief system.
- Humans need to be part of a group but also keep their individualism. Not being part of a group is chaos. Being no individual is nihilism. We want to move on the intersection of both.
- "If we each live properly, we will collectively flurish"
