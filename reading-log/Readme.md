# Reading log
I think reading is one of the most important habits I build over the past few
years. I try to always read two books: Nonfition over the day and fiction in the
evening to calm me down and get my mind ready to sleep.

To remember myself what I learned from each book, I keep this reading log. It
contains short summaries of all the books I read for nonfiction books.  
For fiction books, I write my opinion rather than learnings. At times, I write
reviews on third paty sites, so I might also just link to those.
