# Focus
I believe that good work can only happen when you focus. I use several
techniques and procedures to be able to focus.

* Plan ahead, not on the fly. Preferrably, plan the whole day the day before, but even if it comes down to planning hte next hours, that's okay. But do not plan whil focussing.
* When choosing what to do next, pick the most urgent thing (sometimes has a
  strong correlation with importance)
* A good rule of thumb is to pick the item that makes me the most uncomfortable.
* Do one thing only. Focus on that thing. Do not multi-taks. It does not work.
* If a distractions comes up, decide if I need to act on it right away. If not,
  write it down. Decide what to do about it after the session.
