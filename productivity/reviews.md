# Reviews
I like to refelct on what I am doing on a regular basis. This has proven useful
to me to keep track of what I am doing in the mid- and long-term and work out
which things work well for me and which don't.  
I generally reflect on three levels:

* Daily
* Weekly
* Monthly

For this year, I would also like to take a longer retreat and reflect on the
past year.

## Daily
I keep track of what I achieved in a day in a diary post in vimwiki. These are
just a handful of bullet points, mostly (but not exclusively) work related. I write those every evening. Sometimes, days
can feel like you did not achieve anything at all. Reflecting for 5 Minutes and
seeing what you actually did is very fulfilling.  
I also maintain a note in Notes.app for every month with subsections for every
day where I write done more generic observations and thoughts.  
Both of these are good to re-read in the weekly review.

## Weekly
Every Sunday, I refelct on how my week went. I check if I did accomplish
everything I did plan the sunday before, reflect on how the week went in
gerneral, what I could do better and what I want to keep on doing.   
For every week, I maintain a page in my vimwiki, again with bullet points about
the week.  
At the end, I define some goals for the next week.

## Monthly
One level up from the weekly review, I check how my months went. The reviews are
similar, but with broader goals. Instead of reviewing my daily notes, I review
my weekly notes.
